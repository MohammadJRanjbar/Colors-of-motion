# Colors-of-motion
I used Opencv to write this code but it does take a long time to process a full movie
there is matlab version of this code too which is a little bit slower than cpp
and if you want to make one poster for yourself you just need to change the file name and the file directory in the code which i left a comment above it in both matlab and C++
